===========

Today I installed my clojure environment on my mac. 
Installed the following sublime packages:

BracketHighlighter
lispindent
SublimeREPL
paradit

And installed the profiles.clj file in the ~/.lein dir via this:
https://gist.github.com/jamesmacaulay/5603176

I also followed along this setup:
https://github.com/jasongilman/SublimeClojureSetup

I wrote a hello world clojure project that I can run using instructions 
from here:
https://clojurebridge.github.io/community-docs/docs/getting-started/helloworld/

One method that clojurians because lein is so slow to run is to keep the 
REPL open and develop on there, and only port it over to the project when 
its ready.

TODO - Get a clojure program working to follow along the exercises and 
examples in the one-armed bandit

I installed emacs and played around with the hotkeys, and also got
the REPL to work side-by-side. Tried using sublime to do everything
but it wasn't playing very nice. Emacs is a LISP tool through and through.
Here is a nice guide:

I should write down some of the hotkeys so I can help commit them to memory.

Some helpful commands in emacs (C is ctrl, M is option/alt for mac/windows):

C-x 3		Split into side-by-side windows
C-x C-f 	Navigate to a file
C-x b		Switch to a buffer
C-x C-s		Save a buffer or file
C-x C-f		Create new file
M-x cider-jack	Start REPL
C-x o		Switch curser to other window
C-x 1		Delete all other windows except current one
q		Kills the current stacktrace that pops up
C-x 0		Delete current window
C-c M-n		Switches REPL to namespace at top of current file
C-c C-k		Compiles current clj file
C-) or C-(	Slurping the paranthesis forward or backwards - notice shft
C-x b		Switches between buffers

Creating a Project:
$ lein new app my-stuff

After adding a module to :dependencies in project.clj file, run at the tree level:
$ lein deps 

Note that the right clojure version must work with the module. Incanter wasn't installing with the newer clojure versions.

Looks like incanter is outdated and doesn't work. Here is some trouble I 
was going through, and hardly seems worth the effort for me for now:
https://github.com/incanter/incanter/issues/332

If I want to connect to a local REPL started by "lein repl", I can issue:
M-x cider-connect
and enter in the relevant information

Since incanter is outdated, I'm going to try clojure.core.matrix
