Today I installed my clojure environment on my mac. 
Installed the following sublime packages:

BracketHighlighter
lispindent
SublimeREPL
paradit

And installed the profiles.clj file in the ~/.lein dir via this:

I also followed along this setup:

I wrote a hello world clojure project that I can run using instructions 
from here:
https://clojurebridge.github.io/community-docs/docs/getting-started/helloworld/

One method that clojurians because lein is so slow to run is to keep the 
REPL open and develop on there, and only port it over to the project when 
its ready.

TODO - Get a clojure program working to follow along the exercises and 
examples in the one-armed bandit

I installed emacs and played around with the hotkeys, and also got
the REPL to work side-by-side. Tried using sublime to do everything
but it wasn't playing very nice. Emacs is a LISP tool through and through.
Here is a nice guide:

I should write down some of the hotkeys so I can help commit them to memory.
